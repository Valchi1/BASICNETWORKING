Basic Network Addressing using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)

Take the standard class C network address 198.0.0.0/24 and the network
shown in the given diagram , and create an IP addressing scheme, using VLSM,
that would be suitable for supporting this routed network. The scheme should
be produced in the table with the column headings .
• All addresses should be written in full, using 32bit dotted decimal notation,
The mask should be written in CIDR notation /24 etc).

Applying the IP addressing scheme produced for Part 1, build and
test the network using Packet Tracer. Also apply the following
instructions:

Include 2 PCs in each subnet, labelled Sales PC 1, Sales PC 2, Admin PC 1, Admin PC 2
etc
• For BOTH the Routers, use a Cisco 2911.
• Name the Router at Head Office, ‘Head Office R1’ and the other router, ‘ Your
surname R2’ (where Your surname is your actual Surname eg Kingham R2)
• Put a message of the day banner on the Head office router displaying your Name.
• Use Cisco 2950-24 for all the Switches.
• You may use any interface on the Routers for each subnet and any port on the
switches for the PCs.


Use a WIC-1T module on both Routers to provide the WAN link – Head Office
must be the DTE end and R2 the DCE end. You may use any serial interface at
either end of the WAN link.
• Use Clock rate 125000
• Use Dynamic Routing Protocol RIP ver 2 between the Routers
• Any Host PC on any subnet should be able to ping any other Host PC in a
different subnet.
